1. Write a Python program that takes N worker nodes and distributes M tasks among them using round-robin scheduling. Simulate each node processing tasks and print results.

2. Simulate task aggregation using Python's concurrent. Futures. Write a program that divides a large task (e.g., sum of N integers) among multiple grid nodes and merges the results.

3. Create a Python class Virtualization that has methods to list benefits and drawbacks. Let users input scenarios, and the program should suggest if virtualization is beneficial.

4. Write a function that takes hypervisor names as input (like "VMware ESXi", "KVM", "VirtualBox") and identifies whether it's Type 1 or Type 2 based on an internal dictionary.

5. Simulate user interaction with IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers using Python classes. Show how each model abstracts infrastructure differently with practical examples (e.g., hosting a web app).

6. Write a Python program that takes user input (security level, budget, scalability need) and recommends the most suitable deployment model: Public, Private, or Hybrid.

7. Simulate sending packets with delays using Python's time module. Introduce artificial latency to demonstrate effects on cloud-based apps.

8. Simulate synchronous and synchronous data replication using two dictionaries (source and replica). Show how data consistency is maintained or delayed based on replication type.

9. Write a program to simulate CPU usage on cloud servers. When CPU usage exceeds a threshold, automatically "spawn" more instances using a listener function.

10. Implement a round-robin load balancer in Python that distributes incoming requests to a list of servers. Simulate request processing and show server loads.

11. Create a class VirtualServer that simulates basic virtual server operations (start, stop, reboot). Instantiate multiple servers and perform operations in parallel using threading.

12. Write a Python program that simulates CPU, memory, and network usage of cloud instances using random values. Log the metrics over time and raise alerts if thresholds are crossed.

13. Create a CLI program that allows a user to input storage needs (e.g., high availability, file storage, object storage, latency sensitivity), and recommends the appropriate cloud storage type (block, object, or file).

14. Simulate a Least Connections algorithm for load balancing. Track the number of active connections to each server and assign new tasks to the server with the fewest.

15. Simulate a simple failover system where if the primary server fails (randomly simulated), the system automatically redirects traffic to a secondary server and logs the event.
